# ActorX-3dsMax-Importer


[ActorX Importer for 3ds Max](http://www.gildor.org/projects/unactorx) does not supoort importing of multiple *.psa files.

The modified maxscripts under the *'mod'* directory supports importing of multiple *.pas files which are exist in the same folder and exporting all loaded animation files.

Maxscript files under the *'maxscript' directory are just to keep tracking of the original script files which means that are same as the script files found on the [ActorX Importer for 3ds Max](http://www.gildor.org/projects/unactorx) page.
